## Bio

I grew up in Québec, Canada, where I completed a Clinical and Research PhD in Psychology at the Université du Québec à Montréal. I then completed a postdoc in the US (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh), and moved to the UK, where I am now a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics Education at Loughborough University.


## Research Interests

I am a psychologist interested in how research evidence is produced, evaluated, perceived, and communicated. My research interests include:

*	How to communicate statistical numerical information, such as effect sizes and their associated uncertainty, to non-experts.
* How to make evaluation research, such as large-scale educational RCTs, more informative.
* How to assess study quality and its impact on research outcomes.
* How to improve the teaching of mathematical (e.g., fraction arithmetic) and statistical concepts.

As part of my research, I have developed expertise in a range of experimental (e.g., RCTs) and observational methods (e.g., meta-analysis). Most of my research is done in collaboration with education researchers, economists, and psychologists and has been published in a range of academic outlets such as Educational Researcher, Journal of Educational Psychology, and Psychological Bulletin. Some of my research has also been featured in Nature (see <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-022-01387-7/d41586-022-01387-7.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>)

## Talks
I have been invited to present my research at various institutions (e.g., Royal Statistical Society, Department for Education), universities (e.g., Oxford University, UCL), in different countries (e.g., US, Hong Kong). 


## Teaching

I take teaching very seriously and find it highly rewarding. Most of my teaching is related to statistics and/or research methods. I am currently leading the following modules:

* Statistics for Large Data (Mathematics)
* Statistics and Data Analysis (Natural Sciences)
* Evidence in Education (Psychology)

I also co-lead an ESRC advanced statistics module where I teach the use of simulation to calculate statistical power for a range of statistical tests.

I take supervision work very seriously. I was fortunate early in my career to work with excellent mentors who invested considerable time in supporting my development. I aim to do the same for my supervisees. If you share similar interests and are considering pursuing a PhD, please contact me.


## Consultation
I do weekly statistical consultations during term time and occasionally help organisations with the evaluation of their programs. I have been told that I am very patient and skilled at explaining complex statistical concepts to non-experts, and at helping them clarify what they want to do.


## Admin
I am the research coordinator for my department and am leading our submission to REF2029.
