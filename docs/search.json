    "text": "Research Interests\nI am a psychologist interested in how research evidence is produced, evaluated, perceived, and communicated. My research interests include:\n\nHow to communicate statistical numerical information, such as effect sizes and their associated uncertainty, to non-experts.\nHow to make evaluation research, such as large-scale educational RCTs, more informative.\nHow to assess study quality and its impact on research outcomes.\nHow to improve the teaching of mathematical (e.g., fraction arithmetic) and statistical concepts.\n\nAs part of my research, I have developed expertise in a range of experimental (e.g., RCTs) and observational methods (e.g., meta-analysis). Most of my research is done in collaboration with education researchers, economists, and psychologists and has been published in a range of academic outlets such as Educational Researcher, Journal of Educational Psychology, and Psychological Bulletin. Some of my research has also been featured in Nature (see link)"

I am currently leading the following modules:\n\nStatistics for Large Data (Mathematics)\nStatistics and Data Analysis (Natural Sciences)\nEvidence in Education (Psychology)\n\nI also co-lead an ESRC advanced statistics module where I teach the use of simulation to calculate statistical power for a range of statistical tests.\n\nSupervision\nI take supervision work very seriously. I was fortunate early in my career to work with excellent mentors who invested considerable time in supporting my development. I aim to do the same for my supervisees. If you share similar interests and are considering pursuing a PhD, please contact me."
